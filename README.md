# Privacy Pass

Privacy Pass is a browser extension that makes the internet more accessible.

## How?

Privacy Pass interacts with supporting websites to reduce the number of internet challenges that are witnessed by honest users (such as CAPTCHAs). In short, the extension receives *anonymously signed* 'passes' for each correct challenge solution. These passes can be used to bypass future challenge solutions.

The *anonymous* signing procedure ensures that passes that are redeemed in the future are not feasibly linkable to those that are signed. We use a privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol based on 'Verifiable, Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions' (VOPRFs) built from elliptic curves to enforce unlinkability. The protocol is exceptionally fast and guarantees privacy for the user. As such, Privacy Pass is safe to use for those with strict anonymity restrictions. 

For a full description of the protocol go to the GitHub page below.
